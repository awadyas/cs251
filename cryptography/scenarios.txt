Cryptographic scenarios

1. Alice and Bob use Diffie-Hellman to agree on a shared secret key K. They then use symmetric encryption
to encrypt the message in chunks (as large as the algorithm will allow) using the shared secret key K, 
using K to both encrypt and decrypt the ciphertext. 

2. Alice should encrypt each chunk of her large message with her secret key S_Alice, then with Bob's public 
key P_Bob before sending it over to Bob. This way, when Bob goes to decrypt each chunk of message with 
Alice's public key P_Alice first, then his own secret key S_Bob, he will only get the original message in
legible text if there was no person-in-the-middle attack. 

If Mal makes a mal-in-the-middle attack, Bob will know because using Alice's public key to decrypt the 
message would not work (it would likely produce gibberish). Bob would have to use Mal's public key 
instead of Alice's to properly decrypt the message.
